<pre>

				     One of the major reasons business, home, and other users purchase
			     computers is for Internet access. The Internet is a widely used research tool,
			     providing society with access to global information and instant communications.
			     Further, access to the internet can occur anytime from a computer anywhere: at 
			     home, at work, at school, in a restuarant, on an airplane, and at a park.

				    The Internet, also called the Net, is a worldwide collection of networks that 
			     links millions of businesses, government agencies, educational institutions, and
			     individuals. Each of the network on the Internet provides resources that add to
			     the abundance of goods, services , and information accessible via the Internet.
	
				    Today, more than one billion home and business users around the world
			     access a variety of services on the Internet. The World Wide Web, or simply the
			     Web, and e-mail are two of the more widely used Internet services. Other
			     services include chat rooms, instant messaging, and VoIP(Voice over Internet
			     Protocol).

     				   HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is used to design web
			   pages using markup language. HTML is the combination of Hypertext and
			   Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between the web pages. Markup
			   language is used to define the text document within tag which defines the
			   structure of web pages. This language is used to annotate (make notes for the
			   computer) text so that a machine can understand it and manipulate text
			   accordingly. Most of markup (e.g. HTML) languages are human readable.
			   Language uses tags to define what manipulation has to be done on the text.

     				   HTML is a markup language which is used by the browser to manipulate
			   text, images and other content to display it in required format. HTML was created
			   by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991. The first ever version of HTML was HTML 1.0 but
                           the first standard version was HTML 2.0 which was published in 1999.

<pre>
       				Text is the backbone of any web page. It plays an double role; it provides
			content for web surfers to enjoy as they skim through articles and articles of
			information, but it also gives Search Engines and Spiders keywords and meta
			data. It is because of text on web pages that we have a network of seemingly
			endless information available at our fingers.

<p align=center><u><b>HTML-Paraqraph Text</b></u></p>
      				Any text containing more than a few lines (or sometimes even more)
			should exist inside of a paragraph tag < p >. This tag is reserved specifically for
			blocks of text, such as those you would expect to find inside your favorite novel.
